<button class="accordion">More Information</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Stem cells applied to regenerative skincare products are powerful, complex, and wonderfully intelligent cells used to support the skin's ability to heal. They are able to self-replicate and heal wounds, fight inflammation, and repair dying skin cells resulting in a remarkable reduction in sagging, redness, and spots. Of all the stem cells, adult bone marrow stem cells are the most highly intelligent of all, and that is what AnteAGE delivers in this optimized skincare system.</p>
<p>While you can use the AnteAGE products separately with great results, the Serum and Accelerator were designed to work synergistically. The AnteAGE System is one of the most fantastic, effective, and advanced modalities in skin regeneration. Daily use preserves skin health and promotes a youthful glow.</p>
